=== Automatic Web Application Deployment

The most basic technique for deploying Web Applications is to simply put
your WAR file or Exploded WAR directory into the
`${jetty.home}/webapps/` directory and let Jetty's deployment scanner
find it and deploy it under a Context path of the same name.

Only Web Applications that follow the Web Application Layout will be
detected by Jetty and deployed this way.

The Context Path assigned to this automatic deployment is based the
filename (or directory name) of your WAR.
