=== Quickstart Webapps

The auto discovery features of the Servlet specification can make
deployments slow and uncertain. Auto discovery of Web Application
configuration can be useful during the development of a webapp as it
allows new features and frameworks to be enabled simply by dropping in a
jar file. However, for deployment, the need to scan the contents of many
jars can have a significant impact of the start time of a webapp.

From Jetty release 9.2.0.v20140526, we have included the quickstart
module that allows a webapp to be pre-scanned and preconfigured. This
means that all the scanning is done prior to deployment and all
configuration is encoded into an effective `web.xml`, called
`WEB-INF/quickstart-web.xml`, which can be inspected to understand what
will be deployed before deploying. Not only does the quickstart-web.xml
contain all the discovered Servlets, Filters and Constraints, but it
also encodes as context parameters all discovered:

* ServletContainerInitializers
* HandlesTypes classes
* Taglib Descriptors

With the quickstart mechanism, jetty is able to entirely bypass all
scanning and discovery modes and start a webapp in a predictable and
fast way. Tests have shown that webapps that took many seconds to scan
and deploy can now be deployed in a few hundred milliseconds.

==== Setting up Quickstart

To use quickstart the module has to be available to your jetty instance.
In a maven project this is done just by adding a dependency on the
artifact ID jetty-quickstart or with a standard jetty distribution you
can run the command:

[source, screen]
....
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-to-startd=quickstart
....

Also the webapps you deploy need to be instances of
link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/quickstart/QuickStartWebApp.html[`org.eclipse.jetty.quickstart.QuickStartWebApp`]
rather than the normal `org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext`. If your
web application already has a `webapps/myapp.xml` file, then you can
simply change the class in the Configure element, otherwise you can
create an `webapps/myapp.xml` file as follows:

[source, xml]
____
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_9_0.dtd">
<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.quickstart.QuickStartWebApp">
  <Set name="war"><Property name="jetty.webapps" default="."/>/benchmark.war</Set>
  <Set name="contextPath">/benchmark</Set>
  <Set name="autoPreconfigure">true</Set>
</Configure>
____

==== Preconfiguring the web application

If the QuickStateWebApp method setAutoPreconfigure(true) is called (see
example in myapp.xml above), then the first time the webapp is deployed
a `WEB-INF/quickstart-web.xml` file will be generated that contains the
effective `web.xml` for all the discovered configuration. On subsequent
deployments, all the discovery steps are skipped and the
`quickstart-web.xml` is used directly to configure the web Application.

It is also possible to preconfigure a war file manually by running the
class
link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/quickstart/PreconfigureQuickStartWar.html[org.eclipse.jetty.quickstart.PreconfigureQuickStartWar]
simply with the jetty-all-uber (aggregate) jar:

[source, screen]
....
$ java -cp jetty-all-@project.version@-uber.jar org.eclipse.jetty.quickstart.PreconfigureQuickStartWar myapp.war
....

This will create the `quickstart-web.xml` file before the first
deployment. Note that this can also be a good debugging tool for
discovered configuration and if run with debug turned on the origin of
every element is included in the `quickstart-web.xml` file. Run the
class with no arguments to see other options for running it.

==== Avoiding TLD Scans with precompiled JSPs

Of course precompiling JSPs is an excellent way to improve the start
time of a web application. Since jetty 9.2.0, the apache Jasper JSP
implementation has been used and has been augmented to allow the TLD
scan to be skipped. This can be done by adding a context-param to the
`web.xml` file (this is done automatically by the Jetty Maven JSPC
plugin):

[source, xml]
____
<context-param>
  <param-name>org.eclipse.jetty.jsp.precompiled</param-name>
  <param-value>true</param-value>
</context-param>
____

==== Bypassing start.jar

The jetty start.jar mechanism is a very powerful and flexible mechanism
for constructing a classpath and executing a configuration encoded in
jetty XML format. However, this mechanism does take some time to build
the classpath. The start.jar mechanism can be bypassed by using the
`â€“dry-run` option to generate and reuse a complete command line to start
jetty at a later time:

[source, screen]
....
$ RUN=$(java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run)
$ eval $RUN
....

Note that `--dry-run` may create a properties file in the temp directory
and include it on the generated command line. If so, then a copy of the
temporary properties file should be taken and the command line updated
with it's new persistent location.
