== Jetty Client Libraries

The Eclipse Jetty Project provides not only server-side libraries so that you
can embed a server in your code, but it also provides client-side libraries
that allow you to embed a client - for example a HTTP client invoking a third
party HTTP service - in your application.

The client libraries are designed to be non-blocking and offer both synchronous
and asynchronous APIs and come with a large number of configuration options.

There are primarily two client libraries:

* link:#client-http[The HTTP client library]
* link:#client-websocket[The WebSocket client library]
