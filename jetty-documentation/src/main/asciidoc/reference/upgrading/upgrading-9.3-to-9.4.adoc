=== Upgrading from Jetty 9.3 to Jetty 9.4

==== jetty.sh

The file `jetty.sh`, typically used to start Jetty as a service in Linux/Unix
machines underwent only small changes, such as the addition of
https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts[LSB tags].

You can safely replace Jetty 9.3's `jetty.sh` with 9.4's.

==== Modules No Longer Available

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| 9.3 Module | 9.4 Module
| logging    | console-capture
|===

The module `logging` is no longer available in Jetty 9.4.

The logging module structure present in Jetty 9.3 has been replaced with
a more fine-grained structure in Jetty 9.4, so that you have now more choices
available that are also easier to configure.

The migration path is different depending on whether you have completely
customized this module or not.

If you have a Jetty 9.3 installation, and you have both
`$jetty.base/modules/logging.mod` and `$jetty.base/etc/jetty-logging.xml`,
then this module is local to your `$jetty.base` setup and will be used
by Jetty 9.4 as before.
No changes required on your part.

If either `$jetty.base/modules/logging.mod` or `$jetty.base/etc/jetty-logging.xml`
are missing, then you were relying on those present in `$jetty.home`,
which were present in Jetty 9.3, but are no longer available in Jetty 9.4.

The Jetty 9.3 `logging` module has been renamed to `console-capture` in Jetty 9.4.
You need to open your Jetty 9.3 `start.ini` and replace the references to the
`logging` modules with `console-capture`.

For example:

.start.ini
----
--module=logging
jetty.logging.retainDays=7
----

should be replaced by:

.start.ini
----
--module=console-capture
jetty.console-capture.retainDays=7
----

The properties that may be present in your Jetty 9.3's `start.ini`, such as
`jetty.logging.retainDays` will still be working in Jetty 9.4, but a warning
will be printed at Jetty 9.4 startup, saying to replace them with correspondent
`jetty.console-capture.*` properties such as `jetty.console-capture.retainDays`.
