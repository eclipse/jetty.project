Project description
-------------------

Jetty is a lightweight highly scalable java based web server and servlet engine.
Our goal is to support web protocols like HTTP, HTTP/2 and WebSocket in a high
volume low latency way that provides maximum performance while retaining the ease
of use and compatibility with years of servlet development. Jetty is a modern
fully async web server that has a long history as a component oriented technology
easily embedded into applications while still offering a solid traditional
distribution for webapp deployment.
