Documenting the States of a WebSocket Session.

NEW: (Internal)

  A new WebSocket session.
  It has had no connection attempted yet.

CONNECTING: (RFC6455) // synonyms: HANDSHAKING

  The connection is being attempted, along with the Upgrade handshake.

CONNECTED: (Internal) // synonyms: HANDSHAKED, HANDSHAKEN, OPENING

  The connection is established.
  The User WebSocket Endpoint has not been notified yet.

OPEN: (RFC6455) // synonyms: OPENED

  User WebSocket Endpoint is now Opened (the onOpen method has been called, no close by onOpen)

CLOSING: (RFC6455)

  The close handshake has begun.
  Either the local initiated the close, waiting for the remote to reply.
  Or the remote initiated the close, and the local hasn't replied yet.
  This can be considered a logical half-closed state.

  + (sub state) CLOSE_FRAME_SENT (bool)

CLOSED: (RFC6455)

  The connection and session is closed.
  This means either the close handshake completed, or the connection was
  disconnected for other reasons.
